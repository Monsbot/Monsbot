##### üìú Alright now here is bio stuff

### Things to know about me:
* I think bios are hard and idk what to write in them, so enjoy some useless information in a neat looking table


here are some things I like / dislike because, again, tables look neat

| Things I like ‚úÖ | Things I don't like ‚ùå     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| texting | speaking |
| Nature, like trees are pretty amazing for example. I like trees, fungi and forests in general, I think they are cool. Trees are pretty simple yet they theoretically live super long. And fungi are just big giant networks of connected cells which also live super long.       |   Actually eating mushrooms, idk why I just don't like how they taste       |
| Programming, modifying code other people wrote. Modding is awesome, change my mind. | Closed Source software. Imagine somebody bakes a cake but won't tell you wtf they actually put in that cake.|
|Animals because, cute, yk | people who don't like animals, like why would you not like them, you are literally one yourself lol |
|being alone|feeling lonely| (yeah ik)
|idk what else to put here, I'm running out of ideas, so imma say my partner ‚ù§Ô∏è :)| Homework, school stays in school and home stays home|
